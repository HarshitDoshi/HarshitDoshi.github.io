                <h2>An exciting adventure...</h2>
                <p>
                    Computers and technology have always interested me. I love breaking things apart and then fixing
                    them back together. This made an apt reason for me to go on an adventure. To go study computer
                    science. To become an engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I changed cities in search of opportunities. And today, <time datetime="2020-08-06">8th of June,
                        2020</time>, marks the day I have longed for. Today, I join my first work opportunity at Cerner
                    Corporation as a Systems Engineer.

                <p>
                    I am amped.

                <h2>The journey so far...</h2>
                <p>
                    I have been working with Cerner as an intern for half a year now. The experience has been
                    phenomenal. I learnt a ton of things. The practical application of my studies has been an eye-opener
                    for me. I learnt about how the industry works. The ebb and flow of the world of technology and
                    healthcare IT has moved me into thinking more widely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everything about how corporations work has been a mind-boggling experience. The vast, vast, vast
                    computer networks that are required, the productivity management tools that are used, the way
                    information is conveyed and communicated, all of this and more, has kept me on my feet since the
                    last six months.
                </p>
                <p>I am looking forward to more such amazing experiences.</p>

                <p>I am where I am because of my family and friends. I am incredibly thankful to my parents for all they
                    have provided for me to be what I am.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is for them.
