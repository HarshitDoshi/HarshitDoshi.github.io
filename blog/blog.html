                <p>This is a place where I put all my whimsy at rest. This is where I share my opinions and my
                    learnings. I
                    will write about computers and technology, mostly, but also about movies, music and design. You'll
                    find code and ideas here a plenty. I also
                    love
                    to read, so, if some book amazes me or blows my mind away, I will make sure it gets a mention here.
                    Sometimes, I will share some photos and illustrations I make, here. Do connect with me regarding any
                    of
                    the
                    content you find here and anything else that you feel is interesting.
