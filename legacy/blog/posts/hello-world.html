                <h2>Convention? Welcome?</h2>
                <p>
                    "Hello, world!" is a programming convention. It is the first program you'd write when you start
                    coding for the first time or you are getting started with a new language or technology. And, to
                    abide by the convention, I am starting this blog with a "Hello, world!" post.

                    If you know me as a computer science student, you know that I have always wanted to write a blog.
                    But, writing has never been my strong suit. After years of delay, here it is. What spurred this
                    sudden death of procrastination, you might ask?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, today, <time datetime="2020-08-06">8th of June, 2020</time>, I start my first job. I am
                    starting as a Systems Engineer at Cerner Corporation. I finish a half-year long internship and
                    transition to a full-time role. This made me look back upon the exciting
                    journey it took for me to reach here. I have never been so motivated.
